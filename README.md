**on network automation**  
 _practial approach towards a network engineering CI/CD_  
 
* The CI/CD pipeline should be the only way to deploy network equipment to production.  
* The Network CI (integration) uses the version control build of main-->branch-->review-->merge.  
* The Network CD (delviery and deployment) has limitations in network engineering as a "test" production network is non-existent.
