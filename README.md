**on network automation**  
 _practial approach towards a network engineering CI/CD_  
 
The CI/CD pipeline should be the only way to deploy network equipment to production.
The CD of the pipeline in large-scale networks has limiations and risk that should be accounted for.  

The **Network CI (integration)** uses the version control build of main-->branch-->review-->merge.  
* Continuous Integration - automate the integration of configuration changes.  

The **Network CD (delviery and deployment)** has limitations and risk in network engineering.    
* Continuous Delivery - automate the test.    
* Continuous Deployment - automate production deployment.    

Continuous Delivery has limiations in network engineering as a "test" production network is non-existent.  
Continuous Deployment has risk as their is no manual gate at a stage before push to the production network.
